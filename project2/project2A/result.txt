I can eat less meat , and save a tiny fraction of the water that goes into one cow . Or I can save all the water that goes into superfluous flushing of toilets , usually at least twice per day , every day . Meat may be the biggest use of water that We are responsible for , but my toilet is something I am responsible for directly , and that's why I mentioned it . Thanks for the wild left turn though , that's definitely a useful way to get your vegan thing across to people .
Just more proof that Republicans hate it when people vote .
hate to break it to you , but the globalists only exist in your tiny , blackened heart .
That's the point of what he's saying . You can be unbiased and report the truth too you know .
Average Trump voter income was about 79k , largest number of Trump voters were in groups between 50k and 200k .
gt ; Oh , you'll be long gone before any of that stuff happens . I use to have a co-worker say this same shit all the time when he would come in my office , we would talk about things , he would then toss his plastic coke bottle in the trash when we have recycling bins right down in the break room . He would openly say , I'll be dead so who cares , I don't . Meanwhile he has an 18 year old daughter who definitely will . Not to mention any kids she might have . It's this , well we are old and going to be gone we don't give a shit attitude that overwhelms the climate deniers or people who just don't want to do anything about it that is frustrating . You just want to shake them and say you know the world doesn't just stop turning when you are gone , do you understand that your family and friends and their family and friends will live on . The GOP has embraced this short sightedness and abused it to harvest votes for years . That needs to end people need to be aware and care about the world around them not just what is on their smartphone or TV that day .
We have to get over that . She waited as long as she could until the AP called it and she's been on our side the whole time .
Your serious ? Have you EVER read up on it ? ? Why did you THINK Rome was against him exactly ? Why do you think he tried to remove the Catholic ruler of Spain to put an Atheist in ? Please go look up what he tried to achieve .
Don't forget fat and materialistic .
But he does have the best words .
Ok but it doesn't
That said , is the WSJ our guiding philosophy in five words is there shall be open borders really that socially conservative ?

So let's just nail you down on this . It's your assertion that he did t want to put troops in Syria . I need a definite yes or no . And nail you down on this . He escalated the wars . Final say is on him . Correct ?
Why is this a presidential scandal ? Russia did something , not Trump .
The American dream is alive and well . This is the land of equal opportunity , not equal outcome . No matter what , poor choices will still yield poor outcomes . If you study , choose a marketable degree , and do well , you'll have no problem living the life you want to live . I , and most of my social circle , have had no problems . The ones I know who have had problems are those who got completely useless degrees . Sociology , English , Sports Marketing Management , film , etc . Sure , they're degrees you can coast on through college with , but they're not degrees that will land you anything profitable unless you're very lucky . Not only that , but so many people take out gobs and gobs of loans to receive these useless degrees . Again , no one is forcing you to borrow 60,000 so you can have a useless degree from a prestigious school . Those are poor choices and are 100 avoidable .
I mean if you look at who voted sanders and who voted clinton , clinton got the non-white vote and won . Granted she sorta cheated .
All of those answers could easily be yes except maybe the husband one . The difference is no one cared enough to investigate . Apparently it wasn't THE WORST HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL IN HISTORY back when he did it .
Is this favorite Trump moments now ? I prefer when Trump said I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters . President Trump is going to great . We have the most loyal people .
The US military is full of conservatives , they will not hesitate to kill liberals . They joke about it and entertain the idea .
It's the only plant that makes the X series at the moment . But I promise you as Germans they're taking a long practical look at whether shifting production to Brazil is worth it .
We can give him the same level of respect he gave to incoming President Obama .
They also tell me I'm the smartest and best looking guy in the country .
True . The extremes on either side of the spectrum are rather prone to violence .
Spot on.....power is very addicting , and the money ain't bad either ;
Yah for sure s

I had to move in the middle of a school year . . . it was horrifying , I met a bunch of new friends who were better influences , my high school sweet heart that I dated for three years , and graduated . The horror ! I was in my previous school system up until high school started and the move was the best thing for me . It seemed scary at first , but it made me more adventurous and I've moved multiple times since I graduated . I have no idea how this is a big deal , it'll be less of a shock to the kid since he's young . It's ridiculous that we're spending this much money on such a stupid issue .
One could certainly argue the second half of the sentence was qualified by the I have been called a surrogate as a time or two . . . Regardless , it is not possible to prove what he meant , so it can't be called perjury unless of course an investigation proves he did communicate with Russians as a surrogate/regarding the campaign
Maybe we can get someone , a orange person , to grab them by the pussy .
So his rating went up . Last poll said 30 something approved
I am in agreement .
Victims of corrupt politics ? Gerrymandering is in large part responsible for the GOP advantage
People may take that the wrong way and see it as insulting to the people who were lost that day , but overall I like it .
gt ; How the fuck is it that high ? In unrelated news , IQ is measured on a bell curve . There's a top whatever percent and a bottom whatever percent .
The thing that's interesting about this is that Trump thinks that family members of terrorists need to die because they're aware of each others actions due to them being family . However , he expects his supporters to believe that despite his sons being his family members , he isn't privy to their business dealings . The Trumps are the pinnacle of hypocrisy and their supporters are violently stupid for believing in them .
